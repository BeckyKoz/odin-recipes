    <h2>Recipe</h2>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>5 - 6 cups of bread flour</li>
            <li>2.5 - 3 cups warm water (not hot)</li>
            <li>3 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp instant yeast</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, or the bowl of a stand mixer, 
                mix 5 cups of the flour, the salt, and the yeast.</li>
            <li>Mix in a scant 3 cups of warm water. Stir until 
                everything is thoroughly moistened. The mixture will be gloopy.</li>
            <li>Mix vigorously (by hand or with the mixer) for 5 minutes, 
                or until the gloop starts to become stringy. </li>
            <li>Add in more flour until the dough can hold its shape. 
                It will still be a very soft, wet dough.</li>
            <li>Cover and let rise for 2-4 hours. The dough will increase in 
                volume and become bubbly.</li>
            <li>Turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface. Gently shape the 
                dough into a circle. Transfer the dough to a floured baking sheet 
                or dutch oven.</li>
            <li>Cover gently with a clean towel and let the dough rise again for 
                an hour while you preheat the oven to 450F.</li>
            <li>Bake the loaf for 60 minutes on a baking sheet. Or bake in a covered dutch oven for 45 minutes, then bake uncovered for 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>For best results, cool completely before slicing, but it's irresistable warm!</li>
        </ol>
