    <h2 class="alert-text">Description</h2>

    <p>This chicken pot pie is my husband's favorite dinner.
        It's full of chicken, creamy sauce, and a smattering of vegetables--
        all wrapped in a homemade crust. 
    </p>

    <p>This is a perfect recipe to make ahead, 
        as it freezes and reheats beautifully. Serve with salad, rolls,
        or both! Serves 8.
    </p>

                    <li>1/2t dried oregano</li>
                    <li>1/2t umami blend <em>(optional--adds depth)</em></li>
                </ul>
            <li>2-3 cups chicken stock</li>
            <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li> 
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make <a href=double-crust.html">double crust</a> and refrigerate. Preheat oven to 375F.</li>
            <li>In a heavy-bottomed pot, melt the butter over medium heat. 
                Add the onions and herbs and cook the onions until translucent.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic and cook for another minute, until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Stir in the flour and cook for a minute or two, until sizzling.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken stock, whisking constantly until the mixture boils 
                and thickens (about 3-5 minutes). Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Add potatoes and let simmer for 10 minutes or until potatoes 
                have just started to soften.</li>
            <li>Add chicken, peas and carrots. Cook for another minute until warmed through.</li>
            <li>Remove the crust from the refrigerator and roll one half to 1/8-1/4" thickness.
                Set into the pie plate.</li>
            <li>Pour the filling into the pie crust. You do not need to prebake the crust.</li>
            <li>Roll out the top crust and place on top of the pie. Trim and crimp the edges.
                Cut several decorative slits in the top crust to vent steam.</li>
            <li>Place the pie on a rimmed baking sheet and bake on the bottom rack of the 
                oven for one hour or until the bottom crust has turned golden brown 
                and the filling is bubbly.</li>
            <li>Let cool for a few minutes before serving. Or, let cool completely, 
                refrigerate or freeze, and reheat to serve later.</li>
