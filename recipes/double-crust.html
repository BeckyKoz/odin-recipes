            <li>Divide the dough in two parts, flatten each half into a disk, 
                wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for an hour or up to a few days.</li>
            <li>When you're ready to make the pie, preheat the oven according to your recipe. 
                Roll out each half about 1/8" thick. 
                Lay in the pie plate. Blind bake or not, depending on the recipe.

            <li>Bake the crust according to the recipe, or until golden brown and bubbly.</li>
